OVER and PARTITION BY clause

-- From here we won't use goorm IDE, because that was using older versions of MySQL instead we will use https://onecompiler.com/mysql

CREATE TABLE employee(
    firstname varchar(20),
    lastname varchar(20),
    age int,
    salary int,
    location varchar(20)
);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES
('Sachin', 'Sharma', 28, 10000, 'Bangalore'),
('Rohit', 'Sharma', 30, 20000, 'Hyderabad'),
('Virat', 'Kohli', 29, 30000, 'Chennai'),
('Akshay', 'Kumar', 32, 40000, 'Banagalore'),
('Sunil', 'Shetty', 34, 50000, 'Hyderabad'),
('Mark', 'John', 34, 50000, 'Bangalore');

-- How many people are from each location and average salary at each location

-- Bangalore, 4, 19999 (Example)

SELECT location, COUNT(location) AS total, AVG(salary) AS average from employee GROUP BY location;

-- Fetch the firstname, latname and how many people are from each location and average salary at each location

SELECT firstname, lastname, location, COUNT(location) AS total, AVG(salary) AS average from employee GROUP BY location;

ERROR 1055 (42000) at line 19: Expression #1 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'db_3ye8guejd.employee.firstname' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by

-- We can try achieving it using a JOIN

SELECT firstname, lastname, employee.location, total_count, avg_salary FROM employee JOIN 
(SELECT location, COUNT(location) AS total_count, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary from employee GROUP BY location) temptable ON 
employee.location = temptable.location;

-- Is there any other way to perform above query?

==> We can use OVER PARTITION BY to achieve this easily

** PARTITION BY is useful while performing operations on Non-Aggregate columns

SELECT firstname, lastname, location, 
COUNT(location) OVER (PARTITION BY location) AS total, 
AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY location) AS average 
FROM employee;
