WHERE vs HAVING clause in SQL
-----------------------------

-- Find the source_of_joining through which more than 1 student has enrolled

SELECT source_of_joining, COUNT(*) AS total from students GROUP BY source_of_joining WHERE total > 1;

Error: ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'WHERE total > 1' at
line 1

** WHERE clause is used to filter the individual records before GROUP BY or aggregation.

SELECT source_of_joining, COUNT(*) AS total from students GROUP BY source_of_joining HAVING total > 1;

** HAVING clause is used to filter the records after GROUP BY or aggregation.

--  Find the total number of students who have enrolled through linkedin as source_of_joining

-- OPTIMISED QUERY (Filtering is happening before aggregation)
SELECT source_of_joining, COUNT(*) AS total FROM students WHERE source_of_joining = 'linkedin' GROUP BY source_of_joining;

or

-- NON-OPTIMISEZ QUERY (Filtering is happening after aggregation)
SELECT source_of_joining, COUNT(*) AS total FROM students GROUP BY source_of_joining HAVING source_of_joining = 'linkedin';

------------------------------------------------------
Can we use WHERE and HAVING clause in the same query ?
------------------------------------------------------

-- Find the locations from which more than 1 student has joined & the students years_of_exp is more than 5 years

SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS total from students WHERE years_of_exp > 5 GROUP BY location HAVING total > 1;

========================================================================
** WHERE is used before GROUP BY and do filtering on individual records.

** HAVING is used after GROUP BY and do filtering on aggregated records.

** We can use WHERE and HAVING in the same query also.

** WHERE is more performant than HAVING.
